# E-Waste Collection

This repo contains a FastAPI backend and a minimal React frontend scaffold for managing e-waste submissions.

Backend (FastAPI):
- Start: `uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --port 8000`

Frontend (Vite + React):
- From `frontend/`: `npm install` then `npm run dev`

Notes:
- Uploaded images are stored in `backend/uploads/` and served from `/uploads`.
